## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following installed on your computer:

### Required Software

1. **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **Git**
   - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
   - Verify installation: `git --version`

3. **Claude Code** (Essential for this project)
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

### Recommended Tools

- **VS Code** with recommended extensions:
  - TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
  - GitLens
  - Prettier
  - ESLint

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates your own copy of the project

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
# Replace 'your-username' with your GitHub username
git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-flow.git
cd claude-flow
```

### 3. Add the Original Repository as Upstream

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow.git
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Checkout the Development Branch

Claude-Flow development happens on the alpha branch:

```bash
git checkout claude-flow-v2.0.0
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build:alpha
```

### 4. Verify Your Setup

Test that everything is working:

```bash
# Activate Claude Code
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Initialize the project
npx --y claude-flow@alpha init --force
```

If these commands run without errors, you're ready to contribute!

## Making Your First Contribution

### Finding Something to Work On

1. **Check Issues**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
2. **Documentation**: Improve README, add code comments, or fix typos
3. **Testing**: Add test cases or improve existing tests
4. **Bug Fixes**: Start with small, well-defined bugs

### Creating a New Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Make sure you're on the latest version
git checkout claude-flow-v2.0.0
git pull upstream claude-flow-v2.0.0

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# OR for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

- Features: `feature/short-description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/bug-description`
- Documentation: `docs/what-you-changed`
- Chores: `chore/what-you-did`

## Development Workflow

### Understanding the Project Structure

```
claude-flow/
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/           # Claude Code configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .hive-mind/        # Hive-mind architecture files
â”œâ”€â”€ src/               # Source code
â”œâ”€â”€ bin/               # Executable scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ docker/            # Docker configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/           # Build and utility scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/             # Test files
â””â”€â”€ package.json       # Project dependencies
```

### Key Concepts

- **Hive-Mind Architecture**: AI agents working together
- **MCP Tools**: 87 advanced Master Control Program tools
- **Neural Networks**: 27+ cognitive models for enhanced AI coordination
- **SQLite Memory**: Persistent memory management system

### Making Changes

1. **Small, Focused Changes**: Make one change per branch
2. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Look at existing code for style guidance
3. **Add Comments**: Explain complex logic (but avoid obvious comments)
4. **Update Documentation**: If your change affects user-facing features

## Coding Standards

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): brief description

Longer description if needed

Examples:
feat(neural): add new cognitive model for pattern recognition
fix(memory): resolve SQLite persistence issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions
```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for new code
- Follow existing indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for file names: `neural-network.ts`
- Use PascalCase for class names: `NeuralNetwork`
- Use camelCase for functions and variables: `processData`

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for new features
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the existing test structure

Example test structure:
```javascript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure all tests pass
2. **Lint Your Code**: Fix any linting errors
3. **Update Documentation**: If your change affects user-facing features
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Use conventional commit messages

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Push Your Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Choose the `claude-flow-v2.0.0` branch as the base
   - Fill out the PR template

### Pull Request Template

## 🚨 Active Conflicts

### File Modification Conflicts
Currently tracking 150+ modified files. No conflicts detected yet.

### Detected Migration Patterns
1. **Deleted JS files with TS replacements**:
   - ✅ `src/api/routes/analysis.js` → Migrated to TypeScript
   - ✅ `src/cli/simple-commands/analysis.js` → Migrated to TypeScript
   - ✅ `src/cli/simple-commands/config.js` → Migrated to TypeScript
   - ✅ `src/cli/simple-commands/coordination.js` → Migrated to TypeScript
   - ✅ `src/cli/simple-commands/hive-mind.js` → Migrated to TypeScript

2. **Modified TypeScript files**:
   - 📝 Test files being updated for proper types
   - 📝 CLI components receiving type improvements
   - 📝 Agent system getting type safety

## 🎯 Coordination Strategy

### Agent Work Distribution
1. **UI Migration Agent**: Focus on `src/ui/` directory
2. **Test Fix Agent**: Resolve Jest type issues
3. **Command Migration Agent**: Convert remaining JS commands
4. **Integration Agent**: Ensure imports/exports work

### Conflict Prevention Rules
1. Each agent works on separate directories
2. No two agents modify same file simultaneously
3. Use git locks for critical files
4. Coordinate through memory before starting work
